      <p style="text-align: center" class="paragraph">
        TEDx is a grassroots initiative, created in the spirit of TED's overall
        mission to research and discover “ideas worth spreading.” TEDx brings
        the spirit of TED to local communities around the globe through TEDx
        events. These events are organized by passionate individuals who seek to
        uncover new ideas and to share the latest research in their local areas
        that spark conversations in their communities. TEDx events include live
        speakers and recorded TED Talks, and are organized independently under a
        free license granted by TED. These events are not controlled by TED, but
        event organizers agree to abide by our format, and are offered
        guidelines for curation, speaker coaching, event organizing and more.
        They learn from us and from each other. More than 3000 events are now
        held annually, and we're proud to be one of them.
