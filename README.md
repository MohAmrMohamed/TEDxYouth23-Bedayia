Alsalam alaykom
This project was a passion project for my school's local anual TEDx event
Here at Bedayia each year we as students combine our skills to create an event that brings the community together
and spreads ideas to each person attending.
They lacked a website, so me and a fellow classmate Aly Mohamed teamed up and decided to create a site for the event.
We created the Web Design team and we were both the heads of it. 
Me and aly split the work 50 50 all the way. 
It helped imrpove our coding skills and allowed me to stretch my UI design skills.
As this was the first year of TEDx having a website and little time to create it, it has some flaws but the final product
turned out better than expected.
After I initialized the Web Design team for TEDx the team still continues working on new and updated sites for the event 
each year which helped people gain anticipation for the event.
